        brief: `Extended stereo image compression method to compress a great many of
        SciVis images within a short time.`,

        description: `We improved the stereo image compression method ECSIC by 
        adding a joint context module and extended it to accomodate the SciVis image
        features by enabling the visualization parameters as input to the model. FCNR
        achieved much better reconstruction quality and speed compared to baselines based
        on the implicit neural representation, and 18.56% ~ 173.54% higher compression ratio
        than the ECSIC baseline. We also conducted an ablation study to show the effectiveness
        of the new components in FCNR. The paper is published in the IEEE VIS 2024 conference.`,
